# Traffic-Aware Scalability Analysis of OSPF and EIGRP

This repository contains simulation configurations, datasets, and analysis scripts supporting the study:

**"A Traffic-Aware Scalability Analysis of OSPF and EIGRP in Enterprise Networks"**

## Overview
The repository provides resources used to evaluate OSPF and EIGRP under scalable network topologies and heterogeneous traffic loads. The analysis focuses on:
- Routing convergence behavior
- Packet loss during topology changes
- Control-plane overhead
- Impact of routing table growth

## Contents
- `/topologies` – Network topology definitions (scalable scenarios)
- `/traffic-models` – Traffic generation configurations
- `/results` – Collected performance metrics
- `/scripts` – Analysis and plotting scripts (if applicable)

## Reproducibility
All simulations were designed to ensure reproducibility and consistency with the experimental methodology described in the paper.
